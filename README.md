# python-rpncalc
An implementation of a Reverse Polish Notation calculator for Python

The original motivation of this module was to be able to create a
Reverse Polish Notation representation of a SAGE symbolic function
for use in a non-SAGE Python environment. At the time of this writing,
this is a *very* early work, and it is expected that there is lots of
room for development on this module. In particular, support for sympy
is planned for the future.
